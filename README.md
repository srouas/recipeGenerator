# Recipe Generator App

Created a recipe generator by fetching from an API, and designed it with UI/UX in mind too. When you enter an ingredient and click the button, it will return you a random recipe based around the given ingredient.

### Some of what I used

- Fetch API
- HTML & CSS for scaffolding and design
- Figma for wireframing and planning the design
- Async/Await function
- Event Listeners
- Math.random to randomise the recipe selected
- A lot of the fundamentals I've learned over the last few weeks.

### Plan

- Use figma to layout the plan and outline of app
- Make logo and colour scheme and theme
- Build scaffoling/skeleton on HTML (semantic html + images)
- Start basic styling with CSS and background images
- Set up the API + test it works (if have time look into setting up more API)
- Write the async await fetch in JS
- Select relevant elements and add event listener to button to automate Fetch and make it random (depending on what user inputs)
- Specify what details to eb shown e.g. dish name + time cooking + kcal etc. 9)
- Test
